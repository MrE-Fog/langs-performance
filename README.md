The benchmarks here do not try to be complete, as they are showing the performance of the languages in one aspect, and mainly: loops, dynamic arrays with numbers, basic math operations.

The times include the interpretation/parsing phase for each language, but itâ€™s so small that its significance is negligible. The programs run for 90 wall-clock seconds and there are 6 identical runs, in order to have more reliable results. All scripts are using the very same algorithm to calculate the prime numbers in a given range. The correctness of the implementation is not so important, as we just want to check how fast the languages perform. The original Python algorithm was taken from http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet216871.html.
